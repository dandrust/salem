    Task 3

    Objectives: Use a python class to represent a prototypical thing
                Use instance variable to store class state
                Use the special __str__ method to "print" a class instance

    TODO: Implement a TownHallCard class to represent a town hall card.  The class should be initialized
    with the character's name, occupation, and age.  When an instance is printed, it should read, eg:
        "Will Griggs (47), Physician"

    See `town_hall_card_test.py` for the expected interface of the TownHallCard class.

    Run `python3 town_hall_card_test.py` to run the tests and confirm your implementation is correct.
