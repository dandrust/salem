    Task 2

    Objectives: Convert a python script to a python class.  
                Use class instance variable to store information

    TODO: Use the functions in the `game_setup_script.py` to implement a Game class that we can
    instantiate with the number of players and then call some methods to get the number of cards required

    See `game_test.py` for the expected interface of the Game class.

    Run `python3 game_test.py` to run the tests and confirm your implementation is correct.
