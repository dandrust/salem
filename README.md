- [ ] 3. Implement TODO in `town_hall_card.py`
- [ ] 4. Implement TODO in `player.py`
- [ ] 5. Implement TODO in `simulation1.py`
- [ ] 6. Use subclassing to implement Tryal cards (witch, not a witch, constable), extend player class to be dealt tryal cards (position matters for tryal cards!)
- [ ] 7. Modify simulation script to shuffle tryal cards and deal them to players. Extend player class to tell secrets and print players' secrets in your simulation script
